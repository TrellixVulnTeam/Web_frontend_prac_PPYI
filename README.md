# DRIFTWOODPINES

* Author: JUSTIN SONNEN


## Overview
This project, Driftwoodpines.com, is a landing page for a mock outdoor recreation, vacation home rental company.  
The purpose of this site was to gain experience with front end development tools and industry standard design principals.

## Discussion

The tools used to build this site are HTML and SCSS. For this project I used VScode and pushed my commits to github.  This site was then uploaded to HostGators via Cpanel where it is being hosted.

In this process, I hoped to develop my UX/UI skills.  My focus was on using a popular color palette, design forward fonts, neomorphism design styles for text boxes, and an appropriate use of whitespace and many images.

Rather than add styles using CSS I opted for SCSS.  I found this to be much more organized, and the ability to nest sibling tags was easier to read when perusing code.  

Although being new at it, I tried to maintain a BEM (block, element, modifier) naming convention for my class names.

For code reusability I wrote mixins to manage my media queries.  I designed nine layouts for a variety of mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes, and included both portrait and landscape for devices that support both.

For units of measurement, I mainly used rem so I would be able to automate the process of editing element sizes, and all at once, by changing the font-size within the html block.  This sped up the process of making the site responsive.  

I optimized all images to reduce file size while maintaining visual integrity.  I did this by sizing images and exporting them with an appropriate quality reduction.  I uploaded multiple sizes of each image to support the use of responsive images and art direction when using a tablet or mobile.  All images were also processed through tinypng to implement smart lossy compression techniques to reduce the file size and remove any metadata.

The current degree of completion is enough to satisfy my initial goal, however, there is a lot of updates I plan to make to this site in the future.  Currently, all animations are managed by SCSS.  This site does not have a navigation menu.  This is because I have not implemented any JavaScript, but plan to in the near future.  I would like to add a backend to this site, a database, and connect to an api. I would also like to add some logic that could provide a service or solve some problem.  These are all skills I plan to improve upon progressively. 

I did have one issue when making this site responsive, and that is, when I view this site on a mobile apple device it does not size/respond correctly.  When using the chrome developer tools to test all nine screen sizes my code renders perfectly.  I have added appropriate webkit prefixes and accounted for retina displays but have not yet discovered the fault.  This will take some time to debug.  In the future I plan to build mobile first, then increase progressively to desktop.  I am new to front end development and was just too far along before i learned of the benefits of mobile first development.

I utilized many resources to learn how to build this site:

Udemy tutorials, Stackoverflow, favicon.cc, color hunt, daily UI, youtube, google fonts
